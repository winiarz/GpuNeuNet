Tasks to do:

1. Copy new implementation to repository. Integrate main function, remove redundant code from old repository.
2. Optimize optimization process. Eliminate multiple optimization attempts:
  - add tryOptimize() in IFunction interface ( if(not was optimized) { optimize(); }
  - replace optimize by tryOptimize wherever possible
3. Try to find where functions tree is searched multiple times (needlesly)
4. Implement printing cpp code with multiple lines:
  - declare print constants
  - declare temp variables array
  - print temp variables assign (in right order!)
  - print result assign
5. Create simple network for tic-tac-toe. Try to perform learning.
6. More neuron types? Try to invent more formulas.
7. Implement OpenCL code printing.
8. Try learning tic-tac-toe on GPU
9. Create tests for functions and derivatives.
10.
