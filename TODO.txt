Taskt to do:

1. Optimize optimization process. Eliminate multiple optimization attempts:
  - add tryOptimize() in IFunction interface ( if(not was optimized) { optimize(); }
  - replace optimize by tryOptimize wherever possible
2. Try to find where functions tree is searched multiple times (needlesly)
3. Implement printing cpp code with multiple lines:
  - declare print constants
  - declare temp variables array
  - print temp variables assign (in right order!)
  - print result assign
4. Create simple network for tic-tac-toe. Try to perform learning.
5. More neuron types? Try to invent more formulas.
6. Implement OpenCL code printing.
7. Try learning tic-tac-toe on GPU
8.
